<h4> <em><strong> Machu Picchu is considered by many to be the most spectacular urban creation of the Inca Empire and one of the most important heritage sites in the world. It sits on top of a mountain, 8,000 feet (2,430 meters) in the tropical forest, offering spectacular scenery with significant endemic biodiversity of flora and fauna.</strong></em> </h4>

<h2 id="subtitleheading"> 1. Fascinating History </h2>

  <p class="bodyparagraph"> Built by the Incas in the 15th century, Machu Picchu is referred to as the Lost City of the Incas, having thought to have been abandoned 100 years after its construction around the time of the Spanish conquest in the 1530s. It wasn’t until the arrival of the American historian Hiram Bingham, guided by a small group of local farmers, that Machu Picchu was rediscovered and got its name, meaning “old peak” or “old mountain” in the native Quechua language. 
    
    Regarded as one of the most important heritage sites in the world, it’s still a mystery as to the actual function Machu Picchu played, with speculations ranging from a university to a retreat for royalty. However, the most common theory is that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca Pachacutec, who was the founder and first emperor of Tawantinsuyo (the Inca Empire).</p>

<h2 id="subtitleheading"> 2. Extraordinary Architecture </h2>

<p class="bodyparagraph"> It’s incredible to witness the extraordinary architectural works of the Inca Empire, covering an area of 32,592 hectares, with a large number of ancient ruins still standing today. The Inca masons used a technique of fitting granite stones perfectly together without mortar, called Ashlar. These stones were cut using bronze tools and harder stones found in nearby quarries were used to pound the stones into shape, ensuring these structures were strong enough to withstand earthquakes and heavy rain. Smaller stones were transported by llama, whilst the heavier stones were dragged by men using rope. Some of the best examples of the Machu Picchu architecture include The Temple of the Sun, The Royal Tomb, The Sacred Plaza and The Pyramid of Intiwuatana.</p>

<h2 id="subtitleheading"> 3. Spectacular Scenery </h2>

  <p class="bodyparagraph"> To see Machu Picchu in person is absolutely breathtaking. Rising 2,430 metres above sea level, the views from the top on a clear day will simply blow you away. Saddled between two mountains, Machu and Huauna Picchu, the area is covered in thick forest. Machu Picchu is also surrounded by the Urubamba River Valley with more mountains of the Cordillera del Vilcanota which are very steep and dramatic. 

For those arriving by train, you can enjoy the dramatic, natural scenery as you journey through lush valleys and past rugged peaks, following the course of the Urubamba River. </p>

<h2 id="subtitleheading"> 4. Rich Culture </h2>
<p class="bodyparagraph"> Immerse yourself in the rich culture during your trip to Machu Picchu and Peru, which has been highly influenced by the Incas. Listen to the beautiful Peruvian music from harps, lutes and guitars, feast on the Peruvian cuisine which fuses together Spanish cuisine with ancient Peruvian and hear the locals speak in both Quechua and Spanish. Admire the beautiful colonial houses and churches and stroll through Cusco’s fascinating central market– a great introduction to the day to day life. </p>
